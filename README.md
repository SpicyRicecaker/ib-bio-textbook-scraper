You can edit the page number, scroll, and use arrow keys to turn pages. 

## Cons

Excessive amount of HTTP requests for each page lol, but at least the fetch requests are cached which is cool

When we check for null in page number, the scroll slows down a lot. Should have an individual on type event for page

We're also not using auto prefixer and thus had to write more than necessary to remove input type number arrows
